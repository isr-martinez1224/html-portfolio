# HTML Profile

This page is where I'm learning and implementing my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and other web-development concepts into an online portfolio. This will be updated whenever I can add new ideas as I continue learning.

In the meantime, feel free to check out the progress or just to view my portfolio if you'd like!
